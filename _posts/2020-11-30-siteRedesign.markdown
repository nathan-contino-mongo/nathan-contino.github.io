When I originally created this site, I had no clue what I was doing.
Some friends told me I should think about creating a personal website,
and I thought it would be fun to write a few blog posts. So I threw
together a few basic styles with GitHub's static site generator, broke
Jekyll a few times, and eventually figured out how to get things working!

Since then, this site has served me well. It's a great place to point
recruiters or job applications, and blogging has provided a nice outlet
for writing more creative than what I usually do at my day job.

However, as the years have passed on, I've noticed a few weaknesses of
the site:

- I originally "borrowed" a lot of CSS cues from the
[Daring Fireball](https://www.daringfireball.net) website. And by
borrowed, I mean that I pretty much copied the styling
because it meshed well with my minimalistic website
preferences. 

- The name of this site is pronounced "Lambda Lovers", but
I've just used the symbol for lambda at the top of the page.
I don't think there's anything wrong with that personally, but
I'm sure some recruiters have visited this site, read "greek symbol
lovers" at the top, and decided I wasn't worth any more investigation
because I have some kind of strange kinky website for lovers. (Note:
this is not a kinky website for potential lovers)

- Random typos and mistakes have crept up in the site's text over the
years, since it tends to be difficult to maintain text when you only
edit small portions every once in a long while.

As a result, I've made a few changes to the site:

- While I still like "my" (well, Gruber's) old styling, I've
now decided to pursue a slightly different (and undoubtedly
worse) styling whose colors carry a bit more personal
signficance.

- I've decided to rename the site to "Lambda Latitudinarians". Note that
this site title does *not* have any connection to 17th-century Anglican
clerics. My decision to alter the title is linked to the lowercase-l
adjective "latitudinarian", defined as "not insisting on strict
conformity to a particular doctrine or standard." I thought the word
particularly fitting for my attitude in the world of computer science,
where I feel I have a pretty open mind about the best way to do things,
but many software developers insist on standards conformity to a point
of religiousness. Obviously it's a great idea to have standards, but I
feel that overzealousness about those standards blinds people to ways
that the status quo can be improved.

- I've fixed a number of typos and mistakes across the site, most notably
the claim that I live in "New York, NY". Back in May of this year I
moved to Denver, Colorado and transitioned to fully remote work. Before
then, I actually lived in upstate New York for all but a couple of weeks
at the beginning of 2020 due to coronavirus (despite maintaining an
empty apartment in Astoria, NY -- RIP my bank account).

I'll probably tweak the site design (specifically the background color --
it's sort of aggressively green right now) more in the future, but for now,
keep an eye out for future blog posts! I've got a few planned for the
immediate future, mostly based around random subjects that interest me,
like my experience learning Kotlin recently, the origins of the SAT exam,
and some musings on podcasts, running, hiking, Colorado, Denver, and
espresso. If you've enjoyed any of my ranty posts so far, send me an email
at ncontino [at] u.rochester.edu -- I'd love to hear from you.
