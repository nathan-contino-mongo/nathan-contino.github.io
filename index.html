  </P>
I enjoy:
<br>
<br>
- reading
<br>
- writing
<br>
- teaching
<br>
- coding
<br>
- bicycles (repair and riding)
<br>
- hiking
<br>
- coffee, espresso in particular
<br>
<br>
Not necessarily in that order.
<br><br>
Appreciative of lightweight web pages.
<br><br>
During my time at the University of Rochester, I TAed seven classes. Those
TA roles helped me develop my passion for teaching, writing, and programming.
<br>
I can't recommend it more.
