  </P>
I enjoy:
<br>
- reading
<br>
- writing
<br>
- teaching
<br>
- coding
<br>
- bicycles (repair and riding)
<br>
- hiking
<br>
- coffee, espresso in particular
<br>
Not necessarily in that order.
<br><br>
Appreciative of lightweight web pages.
<br><br>
During my time at the University of Rochester, I held 7 Teaching Assistant (TA) positions. My experiences as a
TA helped me develop my passion for teaching and hone both my personal and professional skills,
so I couldn't recommend the experience more!

<P>I'm passionate about computer science, english, docs, coffee, hiking, and biking.
