  </P>
I enjoy reading, writing, teching, and coding. Not necessarily in that order.
NYC.
Appreciative of lightweight web pages.
During my time at the University of Rochester, I held 7 TA positions. Since my
TA experiences were crucial to my formative college years, helping me develop my passion for teaching
and hone both my personal and professional skills, I couldn't recommend the experience more!

<P>I love all things computer science, english, and philosophy. Contact me and I'll make you a mean latte to enjoy over a book discussion.</P>
