One of the operating principles of this website is that the possibility of error is simply not taken into account. The principle is justified by the excellence of the entire project, and is also necessary if matters are to be discharged with the utmost rapidity. <br><br>Are there 404 pages? There are only 404 pages. Of course they aren't meant to find errors, since no errors occur, and even if an error does occur, as in your case, who can finally say that it is an error?
